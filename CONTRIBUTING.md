## Clone the Repository

To start working on your forked repository, you need to [clone it][about-clone] to your local machine. This allows you to make changes and test them locally before submitting a pull request.


## Creating your Environment

When you are ready to start working on your changes, set up your development environment according to the project's requirements. In this project, we use [uv][uv] to manage the Python environments, [pre-commit][pre-commit] for code quality checks, and [pytest][pytest] for testing.

This project is a Python docstring format checker that validates docstring structure and content according to configurable rules. The main components include:

- **Core checker**: Validates docstring sections, types, and formatting
- **CLI interface**: Command-line tool for checking files and directories
- **Configuration system**: TOML-based configuration for customizing validation rules
- **Exception handling**: Custom exceptions for different error types

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install uv**: Follow the instructions in the [uv installation guide][uv-installation] to install uv.
    ```sh
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
2. **Sync the environment**: Use [`uv`][uv] to set up the environment with the required dependencies.
    ```sh
    uv sync --all-groups --link-mode=copy
    ```
3. **Install pre-commit**: Install [pre-commit][pre-commit] to manage code quality checks.
    ```sh
    uv run --link-mode=copy pre-commit install
    ```
4. **Update pre-commit hooks**: Ensure that the pre-commit hooks are up to date.
    ```sh
    uv run --link-mode=copy pre-commit autoupdate
    ```
5. **Run tests to verify setup**: Verify your environment is working correctly by running the test suite.
    ```sh
    uv run ./src/utils/scripts.py check_pytest
    ```

## Testing Your Changes

This project maintains 100% test coverage. When making changes, ensure you:

1. **Run the full test suite**: Use `uv run ./src/utils/scripts.py check_pytest` to run all tests with coverage reporting
2. **Test specific modules**: You can run tests for specific modules:
   ```sh
   uv run pytest src/tests/test_core.py
   uv run pytest src/tests/test_config.py
   uv run pytest src/tests/test_cli.py
   ```
3. **Test the CLI**: Test the command-line interface with real files:
   ```sh
   uv run ts-stat-tests examples/example_code.py
   ```
4. **Add tests for new features**: Any new functionality must include comprehensive tests
5. **Maintain coverage**: Ensure your changes don't reduce the overall test coverage


## Make Your Changes

Make your changes in the new branch you created. Ensure that your code adheres to the project's coding standards and style guidelines. If you are adding new features or fixing bugs, please write tests to ensure that your changes work as expected.

This project has specific areas where contributions are especially valuable:

- **Core validation logic** (`src/docstring_format_checker/core.py`): Enhance docstring parsing and validation
- **Configuration system** (`src/docstring_format_checker/config.py`): Improve TOML configuration handling
- **CLI interface** (`src/docstring_format_checker/cli.py`): Add new command-line options and features
- **Exception handling** (`src/docstring_format_checker/utils/exceptions.py`): Custom exception types
- **Documentation and examples**: Help users understand how to use the tool effectively

Ensure you follow the project's coding standards and style guidelines. This includes:

1. **Code Style**: Follow the [PEP 8][pep8] style guide for Python code.
2. **Docstrings**: Use clear and concise docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules. Since this is a docstring format checker, we practice what we preach! Follow the project's own validation rules and ensure docstrings include:
   - Clear summary sections
   - Proper parameter descriptions with types
   - Return value descriptions
   - Exception documentation where applicable
   - Examples for complex functions
3. **Testing**: Write unit tests for your code using [unittest][unittest] or [pytest][pytest]. Ensure that your tests cover all new functionality and edge cases.
4. **Code Coverage**: Maintain high code coverage for your tests. Use [Codecov][codecov] to check your coverage reports.
5. **Type Checking**: Use [mypy][mypy] for static type checking. Ensure that your code passes all type checks.
6. **Docstring Validation**: Use the project's own tool to validate your docstrings:
   ```sh
   uv run ts-stat-tests src/docstring_format_checker/
   ```

Because you have set up [`pre-commit`][pre-commit], these checks will be run automatically when you commit your changes. If any checks fail, you will need to fix them before you can successfully commit your changes. Further checks will also be run when you submit a pull request, so it's a good idea to ensure your code passes all checks before proceeding.


## Commit Your Changes

Once you have made your changes, commit them with a clear and descriptive commit message. This helps reviewers understand the purpose of your changes. A good commit message should:

- Start with a short summary of the changes (50 characters or less).
- Follow the summary with a blank line.
- Provide a detailed description of the changes, including why they were made and any relevant context.
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Reference any related issues or pull requests.
- Use bullet points or paragraphs to organize the description for readability.
- Avoid using vague terms like "fixes" or "changes" without context.
- Be concise but informative, providing enough detail for someone unfamiliar with the code to understand the changes.
- Avoid including unnecessary information or personal opinions.
- Use proper grammar and punctuation to enhance clarity.
- If applicable, include any relevant links to documentation or resources that provide additional context for the changes.
- If the commit is related to a specific issue, include the issue number in the commit message (e.g., "Fixes #123").
- If the commit is part of a larger feature or task, consider using a prefix like "feat:", "fix:", or "chore:" to categorize the commit (e.g., "feat: add new feature for user authentication").
- If the commit is a work in progress, consider using a prefix like "WIP:" to indicate that it is not yet complete (e.g., "WIP: start implementing new feature for user authentication").
- If the commit is a refactor or cleanup, consider using a prefix like "refactor:" to indicate that it does not introduce new functionality (e.g., "refactor: improve code readability and maintainability").
- If the commit is a documentation update, consider using a prefix like "docs:" to indicate that it only affects documentation (e.g., "docs: update README with installation instructions").
- If the commit is a test update, consider using a prefix like "test:" to indicate that it only affects tests (e.g., "test: add unit tests for new feature").

Ensure that any pre-commit checks pass before committing your changes. This includes code style checks, linting, and tests. If any checks fail, you will need to fix them before you can successfully commit your changes.


## Submit a Pull Request

Once you have made your changes and committed them, [submit a pull request][new-pr] to the main repository. Provide a clear description of the changes you made and reference any related issues.

When submitting a pull request, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Title**: Use a clear and descriptive title that summarizes the changes you made.
2. **Description**: Provide a detailed description of the changes you made, including:
   - What the changes do.
   - Why the changes were made.
   - Any relevant context or background information.
   - How to test the changes.
3. **Reference Issues**: If your changes address a specific issue, reference it in the pull request description (e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Closes #123).
4. **Link to Related Pull Requests**: If your changes are related to other pull requests, link to them in the description.
5. **Reviewers**: Optionally, you can request specific reviewers to review your pull request.
6. **Milestone**: Optionally, you can assign your pull request to a specific milestone if it is related to a larger feature or task.
7. **Check for Merge Conflicts**: Ensure that your branch is up to date with the main branch and that there are no merge conflicts. If there are conflicts, resolve them before submitting the pull request.
8.  **Be Responsive**: Be prepared to respond to feedback from reviewers. They may request changes or ask for clarification on certain aspects of your pull request. Address their comments promptly and respectfully.
9.  **Be Patient**: Reviewers may take some time to review your pull request, especially if they are busy with other tasks. Be patient and give them time to provide feedback.
10. **Follow Up**: After your pull request is merged, consider following up with any additional changes or improvements based on feedback from the review process. This helps maintain a high-quality codebase and shows that you are committed to improving the project.
